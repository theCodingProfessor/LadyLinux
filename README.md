# Lady Linux

**Lady Linux** is an experimental, open-source Linux-based operating system designed to give people *language-level access* to their own systems and data through LLM Support.

**Lady Linux** is a **privacy-first** Linux distribution designed to empower digital citizens. It blends the stability of Linux Mint with new layers for **transparency, data literacy, and AI-assisted system interaction.**  

## What Makes Lady Linux Unique

Unlike conventional operating systems that hide complexity behind opaque settings and brittle interfaces, Lady Linux treats the operating system itself as something you can **talk to**, **inspect**, and **understand**—with a human firmly in the loop.

Lady Linux integrates a local Large Language Model (LLM) directly into the operating system stack, not as a chatbot or assistant overlay, but as a **bounded system role**: a guide that helps users interpret configuration files, understand system behavior, and make informed decisions about their data.

## ✨ Anticipated Features
- 🐧 **Linux Core**: Based on Ubuntu/Mint for stability and hardware compatibility.  
- 🤖 **AI Companion (Lady Linux Persona)**: A locally running LLM that can explain, guide, and assist.  
- 📚 **Data Literacy Tools**: Explore logs, system state, and your data in plain language.  
- 🔒 **Privacy by Default**: You choose how your data is stored, shared, and annotated.  
- 🖥️ **Web-based Interface**: Manage your system with FastAPI + a browser UI.  

## Why Lady Linux?

Modern computing systems increasingly:
- Obscure how data is collected, stored, and shared
- Shift configuration behind abstract toggles
- Remove user agency in favor of convenience
- Discourage inspection, repair, and learning

Lady Linux exists to reverse those trends.

Its goals are to:
- Improve **data literacy**
- Restore **inspectability and agency**
- Make operating systems **teachable**
- Enable **human-in-the-loop automation**
- Serve as an educational platform for systems, security, and AI

## Who is Lady Linux?

- **Conversational OS model**  
  Users interact with the system using natural language to *inspect*, not blindly modify, system state.

- **LLM as infrastructure, not product**  
  The LLM is local-first, permission-scoped, auditable, and reversible.

- **Human-in-the-loop by design**  
  No autonomous system changes without explicit approval pathways.

- **Minimal, inspectable base system**  
  Built on Linux fundamentals with deliberate avoidance of unnecessary bloat.

- **Education-first architecture**  
  Lady Linux doubles as a living operating systems lab.


## Project Status

🚧 **Early Development / Scaffolding Phase**

This repository currently contains:
- Project vision and architecture
- Capstone-ready documentation
- Design constraints and scope definitions

Code will follow once architectural boundaries are finalized.


## Who Is This For?

- Students studying operating systems, security, HCI, or AI
- Educators seeking teachable system platforms
- Open-source contributors (technical and non-technical)
- Researchers in data rights, AI safety, and system transparency
- Curious users who want to understand their machines
