# Lady Linux as a Senior Capstone Project

Lady Linux is designed to support multi-role, interdisciplinary capstone teams.

---

## Capstone Scope (Initial Release)

A successful capstone implementation may include:

- Minimal Linux base system
- Python-based abstraction API
- Local LLM with inspection-only permissions
- One configurable domain (e.g., updates, networking, storage)
- Logging and rollback support
- CLI or basic GUI interface

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

| Criterion       | Addressed By                   |
|-----------------|--------------------------------|
| Complexity      | Multi-layer system integration |
| Originality     | Conversational OS architecture |
| Technical Depth | OS + AI + security             |
| Risk Management | Human-in-the-loop design       |
| Integration     | Unified system stack           |


Lady Linux is intentionally structured to be ambitious but bounded.
