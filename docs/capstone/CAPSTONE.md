# Lady Linux as a Senior Capstone Project

Lady Linux is designed to support multi-role, interdisciplinary capstone teams.

---

## Capstone Scope (Initial Release)

A successful capstone implementation may include:

- Minimal Linux base system
- Python-based abstraction API
- Local LLM with inspection-only permissions
- One configurable domain (e.g. updates, networking, storage)
- Logging and rollback support
- CLI or basic GUI interface

---

## Out of Scope (Capstone Phase)

- Full mobile deployment
- Custom kernel development
- Autonomous system agents
- Large-scale user data analytics

---

## Suggested Student Roles

- OS / Systems Engineer
- Security & Permissions Engineer
- LLM Integration Engineer
- Data Representation Engineer
- UI / HCI Designer
- Documentation & Ethics Lead
- Project Manager

---

## Educational Outcomes

Students will gain experience in:
- Operating systems internals
- Secure API design
- Human-centered computing
- AI systems integration
- Ethical system design
- Collaborative open-source workflows

## Evaluation Criteria Alignment

| Criterion | Addressed By |
|--------|-------------|
| Complexity | Multi-layer system integration |
| Originality | Conversational OS architecture |
| Technical Depth | OS + AI + security |
| Risk Management | Human-in-the-loop design |
| Integration | Unified system stack |

Lady Linux is intentionally structured to be ambitious but bounded.
