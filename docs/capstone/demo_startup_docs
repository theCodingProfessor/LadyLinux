Starting up Lady Linux

Everyday Workflow for Running the App
1. Start the Ollama Service

Ollama runs as a background system service once installed.

On most Linux setups, ollama installs and registers a systemd service:

> systemctl status ollama

If active, Ollama is already listening on http://localhost:11434.

If not running, start it:
> systemctl start ollama

To have it always start on boot:
> systemctl enable ollama

✅ That means you do NOT have to manually load the model into memory each time.
When your FastAPI app calls POST /api/generate, Ollama will automatically:

Load the requested model (e.g., phi3:mini) from disk into memory if not already loaded.

Keep it “warm” in memory for reuse until idle.


2. Verify the Model is Available

Before using the web app, check Ollama knows about your model:
> ollama list

If the model isn’t installed, you’ll need to pull it once:
> ollama pull phi3:mini

3. Start the FastAPI App

From your project directory:

> uvicorn api_layer:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000

4. Everyday Usage Flow
Confirm Ollama service is running (systemctl status ollama).
Confirm model is available (ollama list).
Start FastAPI app (uvicorn ...).
Open browser at http://localhost:8000.
Chat away. 🎉

5. (Optional) CLI vs Web App

CLI: You can still test directly:

> ollama run phi3:mini "Hello, who are you?"

Web App: Uses the same Ollama service, just through FastAPI.

Both can run at the same time, since they’re hitting the same backend API.

🔑 Key Takeaway

Everyday use = Start FastAPI + ensure Ollama service is running.

No need to “manually load” the LLM each time — Ollama does that automatically when the first request arrives.
