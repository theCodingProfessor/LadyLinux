# Hi, I'm Sam Coldwater 

I build things where software meets hardware… and occasionally where things meet unexpected errors.

## What I Do
- Convince computers to behave
- Debug problems I created 10 minutes earlier
- Build systems that (eventually) work

## Current Projects
- Code and Circuit – because one discipline wasn’t complicated enough
- Learning Linux deeper than is socially necessary
- Designing databases that won’t collapse under pressure

## Tools I Argue With
- Python
- PostgreSQL
- Linux
- Git (we have a complicated relationship)

## Fun Facts
- I enjoy calculus. Not.
- I think documentation is attractive.
- I have broken more systems than most people have used.
