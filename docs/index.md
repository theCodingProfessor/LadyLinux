## Lady Linux Documentation Landing Page

Welcome to Lady Linux, an educational Linux distribution designed to empower users to better manage their data, devices, and digital citizenship.

Lady Linux is unique in its integration of a built-in conversational assistant (the “Lady”), powered by a fine-tuned LLM, which helps users interact with and understand their system in natural language.

### Mission

Lady Linux is a guiding, inclusive, and accessible operating system. The Lady is a presence rather than a literal image; she supports and teaches, illuminating the user’s path through their digital environment. 

The OS is designed to be:

<strong>Accessible: </strong>Full support for users who are blind, deaf, or have other disabilities.

<strong>Educational: </strong>Assists users in managing devices, system settings, PII, and overall digital citizenship.

<strong>Extensible: </strong>Designed for contributors to build and improve both the OS and the integrated LLM API.

> UI & Accessibility: ui_design_doc.md — Buttons, menus, dialogs, themes, and accessibility-first practices.

#### Technical Resources
