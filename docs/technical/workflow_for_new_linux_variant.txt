Host Machine Setup 
Create a Custom OS (from a Linux Variant) 

1) Define the Goals of the OS
2) Select the OS to model from (download and verify) 
Linux Mint 22.2 "Zara" (Cinnamon Desktop)

Get ISO (Harvard School of Engineering) 
https://mirrors.seas.harvard.edu/linuxmint/stable/22.2/linuxmint-22.2-cinnamon-64bit.iso 

Verify the Integrity of the ISO

All Steps that follow use a virtual machine

Create a New Virtual Machine using the selected Linux OS

Build a VM (using VM Workstation Pro) and run the OS as a VM
Recommendation (balanced for MVP testing):
  Keep Ubuntu 64-bit as the VM type.
  Disk: 40 GB (don’t go lower).
  RAM: 12-16 GB (recommended), production 8-12 GB.
  CPU: 4–6 cores x processors (use 8 cores only if needed).
  Networking: NAT (switch later if you need external clients).

This setup provides a good balance of performance and host system stability, especially since VMware Workstation will share your laptop’s physical resources.

Run the VM to verify it works 
Install the Linux Mint OS (don't make updates to the Live Disk)

Update the machine:

> sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade -y

Strip out Unneeded Packages:
